This is a suite of tools created to aid the 3D character creation and animation pipeline with Autodesk Maya.

I have also included the following external scripts which are not mine, are free to the public and included in the menu:
	- csAdvancedRename.mel

You are welcome to use and distribute this script, however, if you do so, send me a quick e-mail with your name and it's use.

If you use the script for a commercial project, please contribute via PayPal using the email address above.

Installation:
	- Copy the "/cs" folder to you documents/maya/scripts folder
	- Launch the suite using the csLaunch.mel script
	- It is recommended to create a shortcut on the shelf:
		source "cs/csLaunch.mel";
